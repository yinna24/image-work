#Image work

##Scale and convert images using PIL

##Scenario

you are in the process of updating your website, you have a bunch of image files that were delivered to you in the 
wrong format. you can use Python to get these images ready for launch.

##Working

the imageWork.py script uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL),
loops through the images in the images folder,

*rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise,

*resizes the image from 192x192 to 128x128,

*saves the image to a new folder (opt/icons) in .jpeg format.
